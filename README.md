# boredom-buster
A random activity generator for when you don't know what to do.

I used The Bored API (https://www.boredapi.com) to create this app. I created the functions that make the API calls in client/api.js, and called those functions within the React component Generator.jsx.

The tech stack used for this project: React, Node.js, Express.js


# To get started:
